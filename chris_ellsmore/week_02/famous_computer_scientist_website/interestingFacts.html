            <h2>Interesting Facts about Claude Shannon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Claude may have been super smart, but he did have some hobbies outside of his studies. He was fascinated by juggling, unicycling and chess. He invented juggling machines, as well as a flame-throwing trumpet!</li>
                <li>Shannon and his wife Betty also used to go on weekends to Las Vegas with MIT mathematician Ed Thorp,[31] and made very successful forays in blackjack using game theory type methods co-developed with fellow Bell Labs associate John L. Kelly
                    Jr., a physicist, based on principles of information theory.[32] His method, known as the High-Low method, a level 1 count methodology, works by adding 1, 0, or -1 depending on the cards that appear.[33][34] Shannon and Thorp also
                    invented a small, concealable computer to help them calculate odds while gambling</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Interesting Facts about Richard Stallman</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Along with his native English, Stallman is also fluent enough in French and Spanish to deliver his two-hour speeches in those languages, and claims a "somewhat flawed" command of Indonesian.</li>
                <li>Stallman recommends not owning a mobile phone,[106] as he believes the tracking of cell phones creates harmful privacy issues.[107] Also, Stallman avoids use of a key card to enter the building where his office is located.[46] Such a system
                    would track the locations and times of doors entered. For personal reasons, he generally does not browse the web with an active connection on his personal computer; rather, he has a server fetch web pages with wget and send them to
                    his e-mail mailbox, claiming to limit direct access via browsers to a few sites such as his own or those related to his work with GNU and the FSF.[67][108]</li>
